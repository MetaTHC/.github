## Project MetaTHC
###### Meta³ HyperCube - Fighting the oppression of companies, organisations and governments.

> Libertarianism (from French: libertaire, "libertarian"; from Latin: libertas, "freedom") is a political philosophy that upholds liberty as a core value.

<p>Technology is growing exponentially and far beyond our current understanding. It comes at a very high price and one that many of you take for granted, our
liberties and freedoms are not by choice, but are chosen for us from <strong>birth</strong>, through indoctrination of many beliefs that are used against and
to oppress society from rising up and taking control.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Freedoms</strong>, should be our choice, and they should be at an equal opportunity for all, no matter where you come from in the world. We can
use <strong>Technology</strong> to bring about this change, because <strong>Quantum Biological Technology</strong> is a reality, we can control our own path 
of freedom in a collective world, rather than a <strong>managed</strong> world, where freedom comes at a price.</p>
